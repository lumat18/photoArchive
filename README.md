# PhotoARCHive
## Introduction
PhotoARCHive is a simple image service. It enables the user to upload and search for photos. The photo can be tagged accordingly.
Every new photo can be uploaded by its URL or just as an image file from disk. Files are being stored on the Cloudinary platform. Photo URLs and tags are saved in the database.

## Motivation
The main reason behind the project was to develop programming skills and learn new features of java and spring framework.
The idea came up from a friend of ours who mentioned that she needs this kind of an app at her workplace, where she works as an architect.
